In the first task, we had to create our own user.
Log in as root:
sudo su

Add a user named student to the system:
useradd student(kassym)

Give a password to a student user:
passwd student(kassym)
You will be prompted to enter the new password and then re-enter it to confirm it.

Make sure that the user has been added:
cat /etc/passwd
This will display a list of all users on the system, including the newly added "student" user.

Log in as the student user:
su student
You will be prompted to enter the password for the "student" user.

Make sure that you are logged in as the student user:
whoami

This should return student(kassym),
Now you have added a new user named student(kassym) to the system,
logged in as this user and confirmed that you are logged in as the correct user.
